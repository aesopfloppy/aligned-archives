**Host:**  
GM fam, gonna invite our guests up on stage and we can dive into this lovely conversation about ZK. We will start in a couple of moments. We appreciate your patience.

**Host:**  
Little mic check, Boris, can you hear me okay?

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Loud and clear, how's my audio?

**Host:**  
Yeah, it sounds pretty good. We're doing okay, that's good. Probably wait for a couple more people to get on stage and then we can dive right into the questions that we have and just enjoy the convo.

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Awesome, yeah, looking forward to it.

**Host:**  
What's up, Brian? You wanna do a little mic check? Can you hear me okay?

**Brian (Polygon):**  
Yes sir, wonderful, wonderful. I think we're waiting for one more individual. I think we're gonna try and get Aligned up on stage as well and then we can kick things off.

**Host:**  
Cool, well, Aligned can join on stage if they want or they can remain the listeners, that's totally cool. Ayush, wanna do a little mic check and see if we can hear each other okay?

**Ayush (Polygon):**  
Yeah, hey, hey, hey.

**Host:**  
Perfection, perfection, audio sounds good. Well, look, before we dive into the questions, let's definitely get a little background from our speakers and allow a little introduction. So we'll start with Boris, if that's okay, and then we'll go around the horn. Boris, maybe a little bit about who you are and what you do in the crypto industry.

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Thank you, Alon, yeah. So my name is Boris. I am part of the ecosystem team here with Aligned. So I guess with Aligned in the crypto ecosystem, you know, it's my job now to help people understand what we're building and generally how ZK can be used to build better apps, better experiences. I'll talk more about Aligned and why we think zero knowledge is so important and why verifiable computation is so important and why we're building a verification layer for Ethereum. But a bit of background on myself. So I guess I have a bit of a non-traditional background. I'm a scientist by training. I'm wrapping up my PhD at the University of Toronto, but not in cryptography, not in computer science or engineering, actually in molecular genetics. And what got me into crypto over the last about two and a half years was the decentralized science space. So a lot of my followers on Twitter and friends in the industry know me through that. I was involved with a few projects and kind of just fell in love with crypto as I was thinking about ways to fix different problems in science that sort of drove me away from my original career path in academia. So I was at Gitcoin for a while last year and helped run our DSI round there and try to get that started. And then about a year ago, I did a deep dive into the whole modular infrastructure, modular blockchain world, because I was thinking of ways that could be used for science. And that just generally got me really excited. And when I had the chance to join Aligned, I was super, super stoked because I heard about what the team was building and it seemed like exactly the kind of thing I wanted to contribute to because clearly there's still a lot of problems that need to be solved around scalability within, you know, the world of blockchains if we do want to reach a billion users and build all the things that we think should be built.

**Host:**  
Well, true Giga brain, man. I mean, I think I got a C in chemistry or something like that. I think we're just barely past dimensional analysis. It's a little tricky. So happy to have you here and curious about that topic as well. Well, let's go to Brian and then we can go to Ayush after that. How are you, Brian?

**Brian (Polygon):**  
Yeah, I'm doing great. Well, thanks everyone for attending today's space. And my name is Brian. I work as a senior software engineer at Polygon. A little bit of my background. I guess I started working in blockchain back in 2021 as my very first crypto job, but that was also at Polygon. So it was a really fun time there. Initially, I was there helping with the Chinese developers community as a dev dev engineer. And now I have sort of worked in various companies and explored different bits. And at the end, I still decided to come back to Polygon just because I really believe in the vision and the product that we're building and what we're trying to enable in the blockchain industry. I guess, academic background, I did computer science back in Tsinghua University in Beijing and did a master's at University of Washington. And yeah, my major sort of focus is sort of ZK-focused educations and also regarding ACLAIR and also telling everyone what this future vision that we're trying to build out for Ethereum as well as the entire blockchain ecosystem there. So hopefully I will be able to talk it in a more understandable manner this time.

**Host:**  
I was not aware of the amount of Giga brains that are on stage. I have a business degree and I'll base it on what I can get from those. So that's just good to hear that we have some intellectuals on stage because I can't really represent you there. But we'll go to Ayush and hear his background and then we can dive into these lovely questions.

**Ayush (Polygon):**  
Yeah, hi. Hi, everyone. I'm Ayush, goes by the name of Abix on social. So it's easier for me to write. So yeah, and that was the first instinct for picking this up. So apart from that, I've been a part of Polygon for around two years doing a bunch of jobs internally, moving a lot of roles primarily around devrel. So yeah, currently part of protocol devs community team. So yeah, and a bit of a ZK enthusiast and a hobbyist. So yeah, you can find me tweeting about and reading a bit more on ZK and the depth of cryptography. So yeah, that's that's me for my background. I joined, I'll say blockchain for like four years for past four years. Yeah, so I was working with BP, British Petroleum for Energy Exchange on blockchains. Yeah, that was my first IRL, I'll say, blockchain project. So yeah, that's kind of sums up my background.

**Host:**  
Beautiful, beautiful. Well, look, we appreciate all of you guys joining. Let's dive right into it. We've got plenty of questions, plenty of things to talk about. A lot of ZK enthusiasts here, including myself. So Brian, we'll ask you the first question and then we can go around the horn if you guys want to comment on that question or we can move on to the next one. That's totally cool. First one I have for you, Brian, is can you tell us a little bit more about what's happening at Polygon? What are you most excited about with regard to the recent ZK developments?

**Brian (Polygon):**  
Yeah. So as you all may be aware, Polygon has a suite of products and solutions that we provide and contribute to. So there includes Polygon POS, there's ZK EVM, Polygon CDK, Mydin, and there's also open source libraries, including Plonky 2 and Plonky 3, which you can use to build, perform, and prove infrastructures. And last but not least, there's AppLayer that we contribute to. So I guess I can just quickly go through them one by one regarding each of their recent updates. So for Polygon POS, you know, as you all may be aware, it's, you know, an Ethereum-compatible sidechain that provides a scalable solution for decentralized applications with high throughput and low fees. So that's why for the past few years, it has been one of the most beloved chains. And now there has been a major announcement towards this chain that we're having this sort of pre-PIP, Polygon Improvement Proposal discussions about having it to upgrade to ZKEVM Validium chain. It's a really exciting announcement, definitely. And also it will be enabled, Polygon POS to become more secure and also, I guess, in general, connect to ACLAIR more seamlessly. But you can find out more about it in our Polygon forum. And for, as for Polygon CDK, it's basically a tool chain for developers to build their own Ethereum layer two chains using Polygon industry-leading zero-large proof technologies. And following the footprints of, there has been OKS who built their own layer two using CDK, there's ASTAR and many other more. Recently, we just announced there's Ronin Network, which you should all know. It's the Axie Infinity, sorry, I kind of forgot the name, but the little cute anime character. So they're one of the biggest game chain builders and they have decided to use CDK to build their next-gen ZK chain, which is a huge announcement, I think. And also our star dev, Jarrett, has just launched an amazing head-to-toe tutorial on how to deploy your own layer two using CDK, connected to Sepolia. So if you're really curious about how it's getting done, and if you wanna build your own layer two, you wanna try it out, use the SDK, check it out, it's a two-hour long movie, and you're gonna have fun. And Polygon Myden, it's basically a rollup for high-throughput private transactions. And using Myden, you can build, let's say like a novel or high-throughput private applications for payments, DeFi, or digital assets, etc. So it's sort of a technology that a lot, it's not EVM, it's a ZKVM, and it focuses a lot on its consensus and

 a lot of the data structure is used using UTXO instead of like the Ethereum's EVM methods. So it's really innovative there and if you wanted to learn more about it, there's Testnet Alpha, which has been live for I think more than a month now, and we're collecting constantly a lot of the feedback and welcoming everyone to try it. And last two, one will be the Plonky 3, is what we know that SP1 from Succinct Labs and Valid8 from Valid8 Foundation is using to build their most performance ZKVM. And it's sort of setting the golden standard for what a performance ZKVM system could be in the industry. So that's pretty cool. And last but not least will be Aclair. It's basically decentralized service that verifies chain states, aggregates proofs, and settles them to Ethereum. It acts as a bridge that allows different chains to interact with one another who are connected to Aclair. And yeah, we just recently announced that pessimistic proof that could be a great access to Aclair security and also interoperability, which I'll talk about it later.

**Host:**  
Beautiful, beautiful. Anyone else? Oh yeah, thank you for that breakdown and you know, certainly busy over here at Polygon and always good to hear from the folks who understand it inside and out. Ayush, do you have anything you want to add to that?

**Ayush (Polygon):**  
No, I think Brian covered it all.

**Host:**  
Lovely, lovely. Well look then, we will allow Boris, we'll pass you the mic sir, the question I have for you, could you share a little bit more about your project and what makes you so excited about ZK adoption?

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Thanks Alon, yeah and thank you Brian. You guys are definitely busy. It's great to be chatting with you and working with the Polygon team because, you know, we're all about ZK adoption. And I guess that brings me into what Aligned is. So Aligned is a ZK proof verification layer for Ethereum. I think people in this crowd probably have some intuition around what that means. But I'm going to break it down like this. At the highest level, our mission is to one, extend and accelerate Ethereum's roadmap and make it a more capable, essentially settlement layer for zero knowledge proofs and validity proofs. And two, it's to accelerate the adoption of zero knowledge technology in general. Why these two things? I mean, we kind of believe that Ethereum is like the settlement layer for value of this new internet for Web3 for crypto. It's the biggest source of liquidity. It is the place where we think people should be building. And Zero Knowledge Technology, it's really amazing. I mean, when I went down the rabbit hole and started learning about this, I realized that this is kind of the future, not just for blockchains, but for computation in general. And we wanna make it easier and cheaper for people to build things that use ZK because there's a lot of good reasons to do this. So right now, it's actually, so people who know will know this already, but something that's important to know is that it's actually very, very costly to verify zero knowledge proofs on Ethereum right now. And when I say costly, I mean in terms of computation. But because it's expensive in terms of computation and because the EVM was not originally designed to do this, this also means that it's very expensive in terms of gas. So there's a financial cost. So Aligned is, well, we're a few things. But the first thing that I should talk about is what we call our fast mode. And what this is, is we're actually a decentralized network of like an eigen layer AVS network that will basically verify proofs off-chain. And this is all secured through economic security through eigen layer, again, borrowed from Ethereum to bring down the cost of verification by a lot. You know, we can verify over a thousand proofs per second and more proofs that are being verified at once, the cheaper this gets. So we actually have a test net that we launched two weeks ago now where you can already send proofs to see them verified on the Holesky test net. And hopefully very soon we'll have a main network. You'll be able to do this and see everything settled on Ethereum and then be able to read all that data to confirm. The reason we're doing this as an AVS is because this again lets us secure through crypto economically secure that all these proofs are properly being verified. But again, we don't need to verify all these proofs on-chain. So we do this just using native Rust code on bare metal servers through the operator network. And this ultimately just lets us dramatically bring down the cost and the time needed to verify these proofs. And again, the whole mission behind this is just to unlock all sorts of use cases. And something I wanna ask, you know, like there's use cases that we think are very obvious, you know, making it cheaper and more feasible to launch different ZK rollups. Bridges is another sort of immediate use case, but there's a lot of exciting stuff that we've been thinking about around ZKML and the applications of that to DeFi, as well as tons of other potential ideas that you can see in our docs. So something I'd like to ask the audience later on is, is what would you build using ZK if verification was super, super cheap? And if you don't have ideas now, that's fine. We'd love for you to reach out because we are looking for people who want to use this technology now that it is kind of available.

**Host:**  
If anyone has questions, let me know. Hopefully that made sense. That was a little time for you guys to think about that. If anybody wants to come up at the end, we'd love to hear from you. And if not, like Boris was saying, I'm sure Aligned would love to hear from you guys as well. Well, yeah, Brian or Ayush, if you guys have anything you want to comment on Boris' take, go ahead. If not, we can dive into the next question.

**Host:**  
Okie dokie, no worries, here we go. Brian, this next one is for you. Can you just give us a little TLDR on what ZK proofs even are? Like if you were to explain to somebody who's five years old, what is the ZK proof? What would you tell them?

**Brian (Polygon):**  
Yeah, I guess I didn't turn up the mic in time, but yeah, for Aligned Layer, personally, I really believe in what they're building and especially like their testnet. I just saw the announcement as well and I was looking through their doc. It seems really, really interesting. I will be more than thrilled to try it out in person today and let you know the feedbacks. And coming back to the questions, explaining ZK. I kind of assume there's a lot of experts in this crowd, so I don't want to make any mistakes here. But yeah, let's explain like a fight first and then I will do another, I guess more official way of announcing what ZK proof is. So I would say imagine you have a secret and it's like a magic trick that you want to show your friend that you can do a trick without actually revealing how it's done. It's sort of like that. It's like basically showing that, you know, hey, I have something or I've done something without showing them the progress or the actual content of it. And they are still able to believe in you, 100%. So normally when we do a homework assignment in school, right? If we want to verify that we have done the homework, we have to hand in the homework itself. And then the professor or the teacher has to look through it. So that's not a zero knowledge proof. A zero knowledge proof way will be, hey, I finished this assignment and I'm only showing them like a sort of like a proof, I don't know, maybe a claim saying, hey, I finished it. And professor or the teacher will have a way to really trust that claim without say asking for the actual homework content itself. So that's a sort of like a really, really easy version of the zero knowledge proof. Officially, I would say, zero knowledge proof systems are a cryptographic method by which, so there's one party, the prover, that can prove to another party, which in this case will be the verifier that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself, which is the commit that I was talking about in the homework example. And there are three main properties that need to be fulfilled. So one is the completeness. What is completeness, right? It basically means the proof system is comprehensive. So it can prove all true statements. Like if there's all kinds of students writing all kinds of homework, and all of them have to prove that they finished their homework. If one of the students had a really bad handwriting, but at the end of the day, they still have the answer, right? Or they still finish the homework. At least the proof system should still be able to prove that this student with bad handwriting has finished it. And it's actually covering all the edge cases, I guess. And soundness will be the proof system is truthful. So whatever it proves, it is true. So it means if it can prove something and if it can create like a proof on top of the fact, then this proof should be true. It should never be like a false state. So this is sort of saying I can trust the system. And of course, the zero knowledge part, if the statement is true, then the verifier learns nothing other than the fact that the statement is true. So it doesn't reveal any information, and also the verifier cannot actually verify if the statement is true. So I guess that's sort of explanations that I would love to give out, but I'm open to any other examples or suggestions to make it

 more clear.

**Host:**  
That was beautiful. I mean, obviously, Boris, Ayush, if you want to give your TLDR as well and we can all come together, that could be an interesting one, but Brian, I think you did a great job there.

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Yeah, I think that was a nice explanation, Brian. Like one of my favorite explain to a five-year-old, one is zero knowledge proof, comes from actually from the A16Z crypto startup school talked by Dan Bone from a few years ago. And I really love this example where it's like, say you're playing Where's Waldo? Hopefully everyone here knows what Where's Waldo is, those books where you have to find Waldo on the page and there's a lot of people who look like Waldo. And you want it to prove to somebody that you know Waldo's location, but you don't want to actually tell them exactly where Waldo is. Right. So this is something that I think a five-year-old can understand. And you could, you could say like, well, I know where Waldo is and I can get a big piece of paper much bigger than the worst Waldo book, cut out a little hole, and then just place that piece of paper. So that way, that little hole is just over Waldo. But because the sheet of paper is much bigger than the page underneath, you're sort of revealing that you know where Waldo is without all the sort of data that goes into showing where Waldo is. There's some other nice analogies about going into a cave and stuff. And this is, yeah, this is, I think, one way to look at it. I think an important property of zero-knowledge proofs that's very relevant to blockchains. So of course, there's the privacy applications. But something I've learned more recently is that it's actually the succinctness of computation that is super, super important here. And everyone who knows how blockchains work will be familiar with, you know, the idea of like re-execution, right? Like all nodes on the Ethereum network are essentially checking the state and running computation to make sure that, you know, the state is transitioning as it's supposed to be in a valid way and they're reaching consensus over this. The cool thing about ZK is you can use ZK to prove that the state is valid without having to do the whole computation. So this actually makes things much more efficient. And this is one of the reasons why we think that verifiable computation is not just the future of blockchains, but also the future of computation in general. And there's a lot of data pointing in this direction. And that's, again, one of the reasons why we're building what we're building and trying to teach the whole world about this and show them the possibilities.

**Host:**  
Love that, love the Waldo analogy of course. I guess we can dive into the next question and Ayush or Brian, if you want to comment on this after Boris, that's totally cool. The question is, if you're a newbie dev, what's the best way to start learning with ZK tools? Boris, I'll pass you the mic first.

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Oh yeah, that's a good question. I actually ran this by our team in our Slack a few minutes ago because I'm not a dev, not an engineer. You know, I write a little bit of code. So this is actually a really good question for me to take notes on. Because I'm trying to learn much more about ZK right now as well. And one resource that the team pointed me to is the Stark 101 tutorial from Starkware. And this is literally from the page. If you look up Stark 101 on Google, you'll see this and it's a hands-on tutorial on how to write a Stark prover from scratch in Python. And I'm bookmarking this so I can try this out myself in a little bit because Python is the one language that I do know a little bit of. So I'm going to actually pass this on to Brian, who I'm sure has more resources to be able to point people to.

**Brian (Polygon):**  
Yeah, I'm also personally aware of that tutorial and it's been great. So my sort of experience, I guess, like how I got on board with ZK was a little bit of a rough one because back when I started, it was sort of the middle of last year. It's not too late, too early ago, but it's like, it's still fairly like a year ago-ish. And when I started then, a lot of the materials were scattered. There's a lot of topics about ZK going on around the community, but there's no like a unified or aggregated resource for me to just kind of walk through from head to toe, like the one-on-one style. The one that was sort of there was the Rare Skills ZK book. So it sort of teaches you the really basic understandings for the math part so that you have a concrete foundation that you build before you really get into the ZK and all of those, including like fields, you know, elliptic curves, a lot of those mathematical ideas. You don't have to be experts or you don't have to be able to handwrite out those concepts, but at least you should have awareness of what those are and what those enable. So why do we use them in the first place? So getting those sort of intuitions and foundation is a must in my opinion, because ZK is a really big topic. And if you want to dive deeper into this without foundations, all you're learning, it's more like memorizing it instead of understanding it. So you don't want that painful experience there. And it doesn't take too long to understand those basic concepts anyway. And once you have those cleared out, then you want to get into the mainstream concepts like snarks, starks, and which right now, there's a lot of examples, and you can also write out the code examples like the one Boris mentioned. So having those hands-on experience really helps. But at the end of the day, you're learning ZK for a purpose, right? You want to be able to write something or build something on top of it. Then there's other toolkits that you can use to write ZK systems. For instance, there's CIRCOM, which is one of the earliest ZK-proof languages, sort of circuit writing language that you can use. It's fairly simple. If you have written Verilog, a language before, which you used to build CPUs, that is very similar to that actually. And moving on, there's like a more, I guess like a higher level wrapped library that you can use introduced by Polygon. It's called Plonky 2, Plonky 3, which you can use to build your performance ZK proof system where you can focus more on the architecture outline instead of writing the actual circuit itself because the circuit is written for you. And of course, if you don't want to work on all of those, then you can also get into a more higher level, which is ZKVM, where you can write codes in Rust or write codes in another language that the ZKVM supports. And yeah, it would just be like writing your own, I don't know, applications. But there are some limitations, of course, depending on the ZKVM. Normally, they won't support parallel executions or float numbers, and there are some minor other restrictions as well. But besides those restrictions, the majority of the libraries should be supported, and you can use them to write your application logic in the ZKVM. And on top of that would be, of course, in the application level, where on top of ZKEVM, you can also write some ZK applications as well, which there are a lot of other variations like stealth address and there's a lot of, I don't have anything on top of my head right now, but if you really layer these ZK applications that you can build as a builder, there are these sort of four categories that you can go for. So yeah, I'll definitely explore starting from the bottom to learn a little bit of the basics and then moving on to the concepts. And then now once you learn all these, try to apply these in different use cases that fit your needs. But yeah, hopefully that answered.

**Host:**  
Beautiful, lots of resources shared there. So glad that this is recorded so people can listen back and hear what you guys had to say because I think we answered that question pretty fully there. So great from Brian and Boris, appreciate both of that. I guess let's dive into the next question here. We'll go back to Brian here. Can you tell us a little bit even more about the ZK proofs on the Polygon side, like maybe about pessimistic proofs and maybe even talking about like what would unify the liquidity mean for our industry as well?

**Brian (Polygon):**  
Yeah, well, it's a lot of topics to cover, but I will try to keep it short and concise. So this is sort of a cool stuff that is happening with the Aclair right now. Aclair is all about creating a unified bridge for blockchains, making them work together seamlessly. And in order to achieve that, this is where the concept of pessimistic proofs comes into play, which was recently introduced. So pessimistic proof is built using Polygon Plonky 3 powered ZKVM system called SP1, which is developed by innovators in this space. Their name is Succinct Labs, so make sure to check them out. They're really cool. And this proof method ensures that all chains might be unreliable and verifies everything meticulously to ensure no chains can compromise the security of the others. So this is a really technical explanation. So if you imagine you have a bunch of chains, bunch of layer twos, they're connected to Aclair. And one of them tries to withdraw more funds than it has deposited into this Aclair chain. Because keep in mind, in this

 setting, Aclair is sort of like a shared bridge that sort of just monitors how each asset is distributed in different layer twos. For instance, like from Ethereum, you have this uni token or whatever, just any other token that is bridged to one of the layer twos that is connected to Aclair. Aclair has to keep track of how all this token is distributed in different layer twos that is connected to Aclair. It's sort of like the account manager. It keeps count of it. So this is why from one of the layer twos' perspectives, if it tries to withdraw more funds than it has deposited, Aclair will know. And the pessimistic proof system catches this and prevents any frauds from happening. It's sort of like, you know, Aclair and pessimistic proof together, they're sort of like a super vigilant security system, making sure that all transactions are legit, especially the cross-chain transactions that move the assets from one chain to another. It always keeps tracks of how the assets are moving and making sure there's no additional extra mints or extra moving or extra burns or extra withdrawals. Making sure the assets are safe. So in the long run, this is what makes cross-chain transactions much faster and more secure. And from a developer's perspective, this really means that they can build on any layer one or any layer two chains and still tap into the unified liquidity of the entire Polygon ecosystem. And from a user's perspective, it means interacting with different dApps without even realizing that they're on different chains. That's basically a much better user experience that we're trying to solve. And also helping solve the fragmented liquidity problem across all the layer twos.

**Host:**  
Beautiful. I mean, that was very succinct and you did keep a complex and a pretty TLDR standard. So we appreciate that, sir. Again, lots of more news coming out about that and we've got a lot of people creating a lot of content around it as well. Well, let's keep moving on here. We have plenty of questions and we want to make sure we have some time to ask the audience the question from earlier. So I guess we will go to Boris, the question I have for you is Vitalik said in a tweet that in 10 years all rollups will be ZK and will commit blocks with finalized state routes to L1 every slot. What are your thoughts on this comment? And I will pin the tweet above so you can read it as well so the audience has a little bit of context. But interesting to see Vitalik talk about this.

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Yeah, this is a tweet that we were discussing a little while back when this went out over a month ago. And I think this is something important for everyone in the space to think about. There's a lot of, I think, really important and interesting discussion going on in crypto around how our infrastructure is built, how it works, how different trust assumptions are needed. Like right now, optimistic rollups seem to have the largest market share. And I think part of this is because ZK technology is newer and is taking a little more time to mature. But we are quickly getting to the point where, I mean, we believe that really ZK is sort of the end game for blockchains because it provides a lot of properties that are just better, right? And it is kind of interesting. I think something cool about this space is that, you know, people are launching new ways of doing things, building new infrastructure. And it's sort of like free market dynamic. Almost basically you think of evolution, right? Because people come out with technology with some solution for scalability. And then six months later, there's like a better, a better solution, right? And the whole industry sort of starts to reposition and figure out how to use these new ways of building stuff. So I mean, yeah, we do think that ZK, like we really believe that ZK will solve a lot of problems we have right now for interoperability. So I think things like atomic composability and interop will slowly get solved. Vitalik says in 10 years, you can see comments on this tweet, Uma from Sysync says it'll be less than 10 years. I mean, what we've been seeing is that there's huge amounts of money and also energy going into ZK, right? So we can see all these projects getting funded. We can also see a lot of academic papers coming out. And in the past year alone, proving speeds have doubled for ZK, and we think it's only gonna get faster. One of our partners is Ingoyama. So they are a hardware acceleration company that's building better, better hardware for ZK. And we're figuring out better ways to use Ethereum to sort of secure verification through Aligned, for example. So yeah, I mean, there's so much to discuss here. I'd love to hear what other people think. Speakers, people from the audience, as I think this is like some of the most interesting stuff being discussed right now.

**Host:**  
Yeah, I mean, 10 years in crypto is an absolute eternity. So who knows?

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Yeah, totally. Yeah. I mean, it's actually this year is Ethereum's 10 year anniversary. So think about everything we have now and try to imagine where we're going to be 10 years from now.

**Host:**  
Yeah, AI will probably have taken us over by then. But Brian, what do you think about this tweet and what Boris was talking about?

**Brian (Polygon):**  
Yeah. I think what Boris mentioned, it's definitely that on the point as in, you know, innovation is going to come and also with ZK, that's what it will enable the most for blockchain. I personally think ZK is, it's just a very elegant solution, you know, compared to OP for instance, like it's gonna take seven days on average, depending on the chain setting, of course, it might take three. It might take 14, you know, I'm not gonna name any chain, but you know, 14 is literally too long, but yeah, for any withdrawal from layer two to layer one, taking seven days is a huge UX problem. And ZK, it's just fundamentally this technology just, it takes a couple of minutes to maybe a couple of hours depending on how complicated your ZK system is. But yeah, it's just fast. It's 10X, 100X faster. And also on top of that, the security is unparalleled compared to other like OP solutions. As in, you know, it's secured by math and it's definite. It's not, it doesn't even have like, if you challenge it, if it's wrong, then it's wrong. If it's right, it is right. Like it's just there and it will challenge it the moment you submit it. And then once it gets verified, it's just there. It's sound basically. But for OP, even if it passes, you know, there might be some errors too, you know, but. But of course, there's a lot of fraud-proof participants who are participating, so that shouldn't be the case for now, especially with optimism. But yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say here is just this efficiency with how it communicates with layer one, and also its security. It's just by design, its nature is just much better. And I think by the end of the day, it's the one-way go-to solution for just all roll-ups or scaling solutions.

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Yeah, I also want to add one more thing. I mean, I'm a big fan of the work by Arbitrum and Optimism, but you can even see like Optimism has ZK on their roadmap. Like they are working towards becoming a ZK network as well. And I think it's like I'm super open to debating this and would love to chat more with anyone who wants to talk about this. Because I think, you know, people might have some, some things to say like, well, the optimistic system is fine. People don't actually care about the seven-day withdrawal and they just want like very cheap transactions and fast transactions and all that, which makes sense. But ZK will get there soon. And it's just like, you know, you can also be totally happy using a normal banking system or trusting big tech companies with all your data. But something that, well, a reason why I was really excited to join Aligned is because I really resonated with the team's, I guess, like cypherpunk ethos and like the philosophical reasons behind why they do the work they do and why crypto because that, you know, when I got into the space a couple of years ago, I was really lucky to meet people who were working on what I consider like the right things and the right technology, right? Like I could have met shit coin scammers and people just trying to shill some NFTs and make a quick buck. But I guess I felt in this community, the same kind of energy I got from my academic circles where people were really excited to, you know, envision better futures and ways to use technology to improve people's lives and help humans coordinate flexibly in large numbers, as they say. And I think ZK unlocks all of this and also has applications beyond crypto in general. Like I think there's lots of applications to life sciences, to genomics, to AI that like we're building this technology and developing these primitives that are great for blockchains, but also enables so much more. So anyway, that's, that's my rant for now.

**Host:**  
Well said though. Well said, Brian, go ahead. Sorry.

**Brian (Polygon):**  
Yeah, just a little bit on top. I guess like also on top of that and there it's a, I think there's a lot of different kinds of needs and different kinds of use cases that is needed from developers and builders. So not saying that ZK is the ultimate only one solution to go

. I think there could be multiples, there could even be like a centralized pro lab, who knows, right? But it's really up to the chain developers to understand what are each one's benefits and what are each one's limitations. And choose one wisely. And on top of that, you know, ActLayer it's, you know, as long as you can create pessimistic proof, then you will be able to connect to ActLayer no matter what stack you're coming from. So, so that's that too. And a little info for the cost. So there was this recent podcast that was discussing, I kind of forgot which one it was. I think it was from the Rollup podcast channel. And they were talking with, with Brandon and I think it was Uma from Succinct Lab. They were talking about the actual cost of ZK EVMs, or ZK proofs. And after their sort of calculations and also capital efficiency measure, we actually believe that ZK right now is already cheaper than optimistic way, as in there's challenge period for OP and there's all kinds of fraud-proof people that you have to maintain relations with and you have to engage with the fraud-proof and it takes seven days, which for a lot of the capsule transaction, like capsule efficiency wise, seven days is a huge opportunity to cost too. And on top of that, I forgot the specific numbers and you should check out their podcast, but it was like on the cents. So it was really, really cheap to generate a proof and really fast too. So maybe the cost is already sort of there. Of course, it's only going to get better. Then of course, I think it's important for people to start to understand, hey, you know, maybe ZK is not that expensive anymore. Maybe it's time for you to start realizing what ZK system can be used to build your applications and etc. And if you're curious to learn more about OP, the difference between like, you know, just like pulling an app layer and also versus other OP systems, I actually recently posted an article, you can check it out, it's in my Twitter.

**Host:**  
Beautiful, Boris, anything you want to add to that?

**Boris (Aligned):**  
No, I think that's great. I mean, I'm glad that Brian mentioned the importance of developer experience and all this. That's something we care a lot about because ultimately our users are projects and devs, and we're just trying to make it easy for people to use this technology so they can use it. So if anyone has ideas around that, other dev rel people, we would love to chat, exchange notes and figure out how we can grow the space together.

**Host:**  
Love that and Ayush, I'll pass the mic to you if you want to comment on this before we go to the next question. Do you have any thoughts?

**Ayush (Polygon):**  
Yeah, I guess mostly the thoughts have been covered. But yeah, I'll say it is as Brian mentioned, I'll kind of like to revisit that thought that ZK is an absolute thing. It's kind of based on mathematics and it is straight in. So like there isn't a way of getting it as a false state. So yeah, it's that's the reason I'll say it has more belief to it because it's absolute on the sense of being done.

**Host:**  
Love that, love that. And we did cover this a little bit, but maybe let's hammer this home. And this is a question for the panel. How do we get mass adoption for ZK? What are the major roadblocks and how are we gonna overcome these? Boris, do you wanna go first and I'll pass it to Brian and Ayush?

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Sure, yeah. I mean, I think Brian and Ayush might have more thoughts on this than me, but like we already said, I think ZK is developing and it's changing quickly. And I think it's on us as the kind of community that's building this technology to really help people understand how this works, onboard more developers, make people understand how to use this and of course, keep pushing the technology forward to bring down costs, right? So like proving speeds are going up like crazy. Those costs are dropping. We are focusing our energy on verification, which we see as a really big roadblock right now. And hopefully with all of these things kind of unlocked, we'll see a lot more adoption. But yeah, I think we need more hackathons, more educational programs. I know Lambda Class, which is where Lined was incubated, they do host these sort of like ZK boot camps where they spend like a couple months just teaching people at ZK. So you can stay tuned on our Twitter or on the Lambda Class Twitter for more info on future cohorts. But yeah, I'll pass it to the others to continue.

**Brian (Polygon):**  
Yeah, I think this is a really fundamental but important question to address is, you know, what does it really mean to mass adopt for ZK, right? Does it mean like having a lot of people using ZK-based applications or let's say just having, you know, like how the layer twos are communicating with layer one, having all of the layer twos to be able to do it via ZK, etc. Is ZK needed for all the aspects of our sort of application that we imagine? So these are a lot of things that we need to really think about, like defining the what first. And of course, what I believe is ZK can be used for a lot of various use cases, especially for the part where verifiable computation is needed, especially for... So this is a really new topic that I actually recently discovered from the Xerox Park lecture at Stanford Blockchain Club. So they had this lecture introducing the concept of programmable cryptography, which really, really inspired me. And of course, I wrote a blog and to record all that. So if you want to check out, it's there. It's under my Twitter. But yeah, what it really covers is, you know, we have been thinking about, you know, how ZK technology is and how we're improving it, but we never really thought about it from the use case perspective. And they have showcased as a vision saying, you know, maybe just like how screens have evolved from previously just like, you know, really old technology with, I think it was like light bulbs or something, but now to LED semiconductor and all of these different components to make a sophisticated product into this one giant OLED TV. So the innovation of TV didn't come from just improving the light bulb tech, but it actually came from adopting different solutions in different industries and mashed them together and then found out this awesome combination, which later became what we're using right now. Same with blockchain adoption in general. ZK could be one really important piece of technology, but on top of ZK, there are also others like FHE, there's also like ORAM and other really innovative technologies that we're all talking, MPC that we're talking about, but we never really try to combine all of them together, maybe even with AI. So all of these technologies, they're important by themselves, but when they're together, it might create a new sort of an ecosystem or user experience or just applications that no one has never thought of before. So that's sort of where I see this mass adoption mean as in everyone on the earth is probably influenced by it or utilizing this infrastructure by it then. And in order to achieve that, we need every single innovative component to work together to build this programmable cryptography future. But of course, if we focus on ZK, I think the speed of proof generation and I think the events of ZKVM itself, it's already a massive sort of innovation that will enable a lot of verifiable computations and a lot of the ZK use cases, but it has just been introduced. So I still need a little bit of time. But once people start to understand more about this and the ZKVM and all of these verifiable computations, I see a lot of creative solutions then can be created on top of the ZK idea. So that's how I see it. Major roadblocks. I'm not like a researcher, so I wouldn't say I know too much, but this is sort of the future that I'm seeing at least.

**Boris (Aligned):**  
I wanted to add something, Brian, I would love if you could, if you could like maybe tweet or share that lecture at SBC that you mentioned and the resources that you talked about, because I would love to check that out. I have another thought just on mass adoption for ZK. And I think this question is kind of, you know, it's the same question as mass adoption of crypto and blockchains, mass adoption of tech in general. Like we think ZK is inevitable because it is, it's a sort of, it's the next evolution of how we do computation and how we do technology. So I kind of believe that once a crypto reaches mass adoption or like Web3 is in quotes, truly here, it's just going to be what the internet is. It's going to be like the default. And right now it's expensive. It's slow. There's barriers to entry into adoption, but you know, over the last 20 years, the internet has come a long way. And even, even things like HTTPS, which is the standard now for all websites, you know, 10 years ago, that was not the standard. There's a really cool story about why that kind of came to be. There was pushback initially because this meant that server hosting costs were like 50 or 100 X higher than before going from HTTP to HTTPS. But from a security standpoint, it became clear that this was just better and that this should be the standard. And of course, costs have gone down. And I think we're going to see the same thing with ZK and with blockchains in any relevant context, right? So, you know, that's why

 we're building in this space. And also just the world, the world is changing, generative AI is changing the game. We're sort of living in a world where it becomes harder to trust what we see on the internet, what we read on the internet, and being able to verify things is super, super important. We published a sort of manifesto that you can check out on our mirror blog. It's also, it's on our Twitter and our links that I think captures our feelings around this really well and helps people understand why we're so, why we're like ZK Maxis, for example, because we think that this is going to be really important for humanity in general. So mass adoption will come. And yeah, we just got to keep building.

**Host:**  
A hundred percent agree. Ayush, I see your hand, my friend. So we'd love to pass the mic to you.

**Ayush (Polygon):**  
Yeah, I'd like to kind of add to this. As we move towards the path of ZK being mass adopted, I also feel the state of things being secure. So like math being the core and absolute part of ZK. It's something that has to be, I'll say, a building block towards learning and securing things. So this could be on a state of having, let's say, formal verifications of things, or even the security of things that we are building on top of with reference to any ZK protocol or infra that we're using. So the security is also kind of a correlation with the depth of the tech that we are building. So everything that is kind of a part of this space that relates to programmable cryptography as a sense of extension to this or more towards the part of things that are being currently utilized. This could be as, I'll say, nurturing or as miniature as the part of folding schemes or the schemes that are being built, how they are being built, the mathematical side of that and the improvements that are being done. So it's like understanding the depth of how things are being done is also a part of making it secure. So that it's kind of, I'll say, a more, I'll say, kind of lacking the word, but it's more like the part of scalability also comes with a depth of security that we also want to work alongside with.

**Brian (Polygon):**  
Also, Boris mentioned, if you wanted to check out the blogs that I posted, it's under highlights of my profile. I don't know how to share the tweet here or pin it. So yeah.

**Host:**  
I can try and pin it up top and I'll take a look at that. I'll ask Ayush this question and then I'll try and pin that. But Ayush, if you mind telling us a little bit more about the collaboration between Polygon and Aligned during ECC, that would be awesome. I did just pin some information about that up top as well.

**Ayush (Polygon):**  
Yeah. So first of all, I'll say Aligned has been a great pioneer in the space of ZK and the things that they've been doing. We kind of saw that we're solving kind of the same problem at the end of the day. And with that reference, we were thinking about hosting a co-working space at HTC. So it's a co-working space open for everyone to join and basically work. It basically has free food, Wi-Fi, and things. Additionally, we took the liberty of extending this co-working space with a bunch of whiteboarding and technical sessions. So there would be a bunch of whiteboarding and technical sessions. These topics are basically around the things that we were talking about in this space, programmable cryptography and ZK research. So it's a bunch of individuals from Lita Foundation, Zama, Aligned, a few folks from Aztec, and folks from StarKnet. So yeah, it's basically a bunch of whiteboarding of technical sessions and thoughts and co-working. So yeah. If you are around ECC, please feel free to drop by, have a check and yeah, would love to have you there.

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Yeah, I just want to echo what Ayush just said. I mean, we're super, super excited to be partnering with Polygon on this. I'm excited to have this little oasis during the chaos of side events in Brussels to just go hang out, talk shop, work, have some snacks. We're gonna have a bunch of our team members there. So if you want to chat with anyone from Aligned, maybe we'll have some swag to give out, some stickers, you know, the usual fun stuff. We're really, really happy to chat with anybody who wants to talk. We try to make ourselves super, super reachable and approachable. So please stop by. Like you said, there's some really cool technical sessions, including one by Diego Kingston, one of our co-founders and our head of research. That's on the third day. Plus, yeah, tons of great talks from people working in ZK. So please, please, please stop by. Tell your friends. It'll be great to meet you in person.

**Host:**  
Little bit of FOMO, that's for sure. The Ag Cave sounds pretty sweet. Sorry, Ayush, I see your mic is off. If you want to add anything.

**Ayush (Polygon):**  
No, no, no, that was it.

**Host:**  
Beautiful, beautiful. Well, we are almost at time. The question that we talked about earlier, you know, that Boris had mentioned was, what would you build if the cost of ZKP verification was almost zero? So if anybody wants to answer that, you have a couple minutes to hop on stage, or you can refer to Aligned or Boris. I'm sure their DMs are open for you. But ECC is coming up before you know it. I know a lot of the Polygon team will be there, I know a lot of the Aligned team will be there. I do have massive FOMO because I know Brussels is going to be awesome. It's a beautiful city within a beautiful country. Geography as you can see, that's my expertise. But look everyone, I guess if anybody wants to come on the stage, hop up. In the meantime, Brian, Boris, Ayush, if you guys have any closing statements or thoughts, we'd love to hear from you as well.

**Boris (Aligned):**  
I think we covered a lot, but yeah, on this sort of question I asked, like, what would you build if it was, you know, sort of not a concern in terms of cost for verifying ZK proofs, come chat with us. We're excited to talk to people about this. I don't know if anyone here is registered for the Lambda Hack Week hackathon, which is happening in Brussels from July 6th to 9th. We're kind of co-organizing that. We actually have a bounty specifically for cool consumer applications, fun things that can show the power of ZK and maybe go viral. That's one of the bounties specifically. We want people to build some fun stuff that uses Aligned to verify ZK proofs. So check that out. I think we do have a few more spots if you are interested. Sorry to plug a separate event that's happening. But yeah, if this is exciting for anyone, please reach out.

**Host:**  
Beautiful, beautiful. Brian, any final words, my friend?

**Brian (Polygon):**  
Yeah, I guess you just covered quite a bit about ECC, our engagement there. But if you are sad that you cannot attend, we also have other opportunities, as in there's upcoming EdCon at Japan, Tokyo. So and also there's KBW of Korea. And also we have SBC over at New York this year and a lot of other tons of engagements. And also if those major cities are not very close to where you are, we also have DAPRA, which is also a general Web3 community builders, a community that they always engage with, the talented developers like you guys. So just pay attention to what they're tweeting and then there's gonna be opportunities for you to connect with us and then talk to us and then work with us and share ideas and how we can help you. But yeah, thank you so much for your time attending this space.

**Host:**  
Thank you to all the speakers and the listeners. Ayush, I will pass the mic to you for any final words as well, my friend.

**Ayush (Polygon):**  
Yeah, so I'll say as Boris was mentioning, Lambda Hack Week, if you're joining there as well, we have Polygon Myden, do build on it. That will be all.

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Love that, love that. Make sure you follow all the speakers as well. Oh, sorry, Boris.

**Boris (Aligned):**  
Oh, no, yeah, I wanted to actually say what Ayush said. There's some very cool, very technical bounties for Lambda Hack Week by Polygon, which you can see on the website in the Dora Hack page. So anybody who is building Polygon ZK stuff, check it out. There are some big bounties for like real, real technical things you can build.

**Host:**  
Beautiful, beautiful. Well look, we appreciate everybody who listened and I really do appreciate the speakers joining. We had a great conversation about ZK and if you're gonna be in ECC, you're gonna be in Brussels, make sure that you go check out the AgCave. There's a lot of fun stuff going on over there. So, much love everybody. We will be back soon before you know it. Enjoy your trip to Europe if you're gonna be there and if not, we will be hosting Twitter spaces so you can hang out virtually. Alright everyone, we'll talk soon. Much love, peace.
