**00:00 Host:**
Testing audio.

**00:40 Host:**
Okay. Like, I mean, I'm just wondering if it's coming through my AirPod headphones or if it's coming through my mic on my phone. Sounds good. Okay, sweet.

**01:11 Host:**
Welcome, Bahadur. We're just getting started early and testing some audio. And the person with the aligned account is in the same place as me. So thanks for joining. Hang tight. We're going to wait for everyone to join.

**02:28 Host:**
Hey, sorry, I'm having an error with the request thing. I'm just going to remove you from the request for now, and we're going to try again after, because we're going to add speakers who have signed up to share their thoughts on today's space.

**02:52 Host:**
Hi Mauro, could you hear me?

**02:54 Mauro:**
Hello, yes I can hear you, can you hear me?

**03:01 Host:**
Yep. Excellent.

**03:22 Host:**
I think Diego is not going to talk right, only Mauro.

**03:28 Speaker 1:**
I don't think so. I don't know Boris may know.

**03:40 Speaker 2:**
Yeah, I think he's just going to be listening. But if I'm wrong, feel free to correct me. You can jump in Diego if you see something.

**04:01 Host:**
Thank you.

**04:07 Host:**
Sure, one of you was available to present us outside of my moderation duty. So thank you for joining.

**04:12 Mauro:**
Of course, yeah, Diego, if you want to just make a request.

**04:49 Host:**
Hello?

**04:52 Speaker 3:**
Hi, welcome.

**06:53 Host:**
Rudy, thank you for joining. We're just gonna give things that, you know, need four or five minutes to filter in.

**07:09 Host:**
We have a play or rather have in blockchain technology. And so thank you for joining. Please be patient. We'll get things started in a few minutes. Once we get all of our guests in and get them up here.

**11:40 Host:**
I requested the screen. I'm still showing up as a listener.

**11:50 Speaker 4:**
I know, but I can't talk. I'm not...

**11:55 Speaker 4:**
I can always do it from that phone.

**12:01 Speaker 4:**
So, I was in a very worried.

**13:10 Host:**
We are having technical issues. Sorry about that. The connection is a bit lost here. So bear with us, please.

**13:49 Host (Boris):**
Hello everyone. This is Boris. Instead of speaking from my own profile, I'm going to speak from the Align account today because I'm having some technical problems with Twitter Spaces. So I guess we can get things started. We have, I think most of our speakers are on stage. We will add more people on stage. We have a lot of amazing guests who signed up to attend today and share their thoughts on TEs and how this all fits together. So I guess I'm gonna get things started now and we will continue adding various speakers on stage because there's actually, I think, a limit of 10 at a time.

**14:18 Host (Boris):**
So yeah, I guess, let's see, let's see, where to begin. I'm gonna start with the folks who are on stage, just give them a floor to introduce themselves, what they're working on and maybe some of the things they wanna discuss today. We have an agenda which includes a lot of interesting topics and there's going to be a lot of opinions to share here. So everyone who has joined, thank you for joining. Maybe I'll start off by passing the floor to Vanashree.

**14:48 Vanashree Rao:**
Thanks, Boris. Hey, everybody. I'm Vanashree Rao. I've been working on cryptography for more than 15 years. Now recently founded a company. It's called Ferma, we are yet to unveil. You're seeing it here first, which is great. The vision we are working towards is to make zero-knowledge proofs as effortlessly accessible to everybody as possible. That's it for me. Thank you. Great to be here.

**15:42 Host (Boris):**
Okay, moving on, just based on the order in my screen, I'm gonna pass it over to Hong, who's the co-founder at Fala.

**15:48 Hong:**
Hey, yeah, I'm Hong, the co-founder and also the CEO of the Fala team. And Fala network is the biggest TEE network, and it has been running for around five years. We started in 2019, and we just focused on building the TE network. And by the TE network, I mean we have a network where the miners can join with their TE hardware. We own zero TE servers. All the servers are contributed by the miners. And it has been five years. Now we have 35k workers available on the network. And those are all Intel SGX ready miners.

**16:39 Hong:**
And finally, why we are building on TE. I think the biggest reason behind this, we all know blockchain has a lot of limitation. You cannot run very high performance computation. You cannot access the internet. And you cannot have very low latency interaction and also handle the user privacy or any secrets. So yeah, with all those limitations in our mind, we just think TE is a very nice complementary technology to blockchain. So that's why we have been building TE for a long time.

**17:06 Hong:**
And currently we're focusing on providing the TE capability to a lot of different use cases in the web three world, as well as crypto AI. So yeah, that's a very brief intro.

**17:35 Host (Boris):**
Thank you, Hong. Thank you for joining us. It's great to have you guys here. Next up in order, we have, we have two people actually on the stage right now from 10. We have a case and tutor. So whichever, whichever one of you would like to go next, please go ahead.

**17:54 Case (10):**
Hey, I'll go first. Can you hear me okay?

**17:56 Host (Boris):**
Yep, I can hear you loud and clear.

**17:59 Case (10):**
Awesome. My name is Case. I've been in the blockchain space since 2012. Obviously, started with Bitcoin. I made an attempt to build a global lottery that used Bitcoin for payments and just engaged in things like sort of mining and exchange arbitrage. Prior to that, I spent a decade working in investment banking before I made the full-time switch to Web3. Myself and Tudor previously built a blockchain called Corda, R3 Corda. It was an enterprise blockchain that mainly focused on institutional use cases. It's interesting because it's there that we first started using TEEs.

**18:29 Case (10):**
One of the main demands coming from institutions was, well, we love blockchain technology, but we can't have everything we need privacy, we need encryption. And TEs kind of just fit the bill perfectly for what we were trying to do. So we built that out. And then we turned to Ethereum and felt like there was a gap there for an L2. One that wasn't just about scaling Ethereum. I think there's lots of great L2s out there that make Ethereum cheap and fast. But what if we could do more? What if we could expand the design space of what we can build in Web 3 by adding encryption.

**18:58 Case (10):**
That would give dApps or dApp developers the power to start thinking more in Web 2 terms. They can start thinking, how do we build dApps that can actually have secrets or can hide parts of computation or information? And that's where we are today. So we've built out 10. It uses TEEs. And so far, TEEs are serving us wonderfully. And I'll hand over to my colleague Tida.

**19:54 Tudor (10):**
Hi everyone. So I'm Tudor, I'm the CTO of TEN. Yeah, this case presented already. Yeah, so I'll hand over to the next speaker.

**20:06 Host (Boris):**
Thanks guys, great to have you here. Next up, I'll introduce Zheng Long, who's the co-founder of Automata.

**20:14 Zheng Long (Automata):**
Thanks Boris. Hi there everyone, my name is Cheng Leong. I'm the founder of Automata. Just a little bit of background for myself. Before starting Automata, I was actually a research fellow at the National University of Singapore and then my kind of like research area actually has to do with system security. I've kind of like did some research into like TEs back in like 2014, 2015 and then Intel S-Jets in 2016. Where I wrote a paper describing an attack on how we can extract encryption keys from a T and Claves using side channels.

**20:45 Zheng Long (Automata):**
So that said, I think we can delve a little bit in some of the discussions later. So what really is Automata? I think the goal or what Automata seeks to achieve is to really bring machine trust to the entire Web3 ecosystem. And we like to say that we have this machine attestation layer for TEs built by humans. So really excited to be on this panel. And then would love to see the discussion that is being brought about. Back to Boris. Thank you.

**21:44 Host (Boris):**
Also super excited to hear everyone's thoughts today and maybe get into some debates

. Moving along, I'm gonna introduce Brecht, who is a co-founder and CTO at Tyco.

**21:57 Brecht (Tyco):**
Hey everyone. So yeah, I'm Brecht. I've been making a roll-up for quite a while now. So I've first started looping now with Tyco. So Tyco launched, I think around two months ago, we launched our roll-up. And it actually, well, it should be a ZK roll-up, but for now it only has the SGX proofs live. So we are approving all blocks with SGX, and the ZK proof will be coming around next month or something. So then we'll actually have both proofs live, which is kind of like our goal. So yeah, so we are mostly interested in for like the multi-prover aspect of it for like increasing the security. But we're also like interested especially now that I'm also working on on the Gwyneth conflict the next roll up at Tyco. We're also like very interested in like the real-time proving capabilities of it so fast cheap and still high high security levels. Especially if you combine them together. But yeah, it will be great to discuss these things. Thanks.

**23:26 Host (Boris):**
Thank you, Brecht. Fast, cheap, and secure. I love the sound of that. OK, finally, last but not least, we have Mauro, who's one of our co-founders here at Align, and also our head of engineering, who will be representing us and talking about our sort of technical notes and maybe some of the things that we are doing with TEEs. Mauro, would you like to add anything?

**23:41 Mauro (Aligned):**
Yeah, so thanks for the introduction. I think that's it. kind of summarize it. But yes, for those who don't know, we are building a line. It's an integrity layer that is going to reduce the cost and the latency of verification of CK plus and the E-SAT testations. So we expect to be able to help other teams who are building applications with E-SAT and CK to have really, a really efficient way to put their resources in Ethereum or other cell tools change. Thank you Boris.

**24:00 Host (Boris):**
Thank you, Mauro. And again, thank you for everyone who has joined as a guest and a speaker and everyone who joined in to listen and learn more about TEEs and what all this sort of recent hype is about. I know I personally was, over the last few weeks, especially post-ECC, I've seen a lot of stuff about this and it's a topic that I didn't really have a chance to dive into before. So I think just to kind of get everyone on the same page, first, I'll just say the things that I think we're going to cover today, and we'll see how the conversation goes.

**24:30 Host (Boris):**
I think we should start with an introduction to trust execution environments, just to get everyone on the same page. I think we should talk about how this compares to ZK and other cryptographic primitives, like multi-party computation, fully homomorphic encryption, the different trust assumptions, use cases for each, when you should use one versus the other. And I think we can also get into things like how we can work together as a community and an industry to co-create the TEE stack, what kind of challenges this technology faces in terms of adoption and usage, and also how this might look when we're thinking about TEEs at the app layer versus the info layer.

**24:58 Host (Boris):**
That's the sort of general outline of what we wanna cover today. And I guess actually we didn't have somebody sign up specifically to introduce TEs at a basic level, sort of explain like I'm five. So if anyone on the stage right now would like to give that a shot, that would be super helpful. I mean, I can give it a shot, but I think.

**25:04 Zheng Long (Automata):**
Alright. Shenglong, please.

**25:41 Zheng Long (Automata):**
Okay, I'll try to give a really brief overview of what TE is. So I'll start off with a kind of analogy for those non-technical people in the audience, and then I'll move on to talk a little bit on the actual implementation of the TE and what it means to have a TE, what are some of the guarantees that it gives, what is the relationship of TEs compared to other cryptographic primitives. I would actually argue that TE is one of the cryptographic primitives that we have. So maybe let's start off with the kind of analogy that I like to give. So the TE, we can actually imagine the TE as being.

**26:11 Zheng Long (Automata):**
When you open it up, there's this little fairy that lives inside this magical box. And what this fairy allows you to do is that you can write down some instructions that you want to perform. For example, I have instructions on how to make the best cupcake in the world, the best banana cupcake. So I have ingredients on the list like two bananas with some flour and some eggs and some milk.

**27:08 Zheng Long (Automata):**
And like step one do something step.

**27:50 Brecht (Tyco):**
Hello, I think we cannot hear Zheng Long. Hello?

**27:58 Host (Boris):**
Hello? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can hear you.

**28:01 Host (Boris):**
Oh, OK, great. Sorry. So where was I when I kind of like broke off?

**28:12 Host (Boris):**
I think it's after the magic box that you mentioned make the best cake instruction.

**28:18 Zheng Long (Automata):**
Ah, I see. Okay, so I'll kind of repeat a little bit. So basically, there's the box, there's the recipe and the ingredients that goes with the recipe. So what this fairy would do in this magic box, I will close the magic box up. And this fairy would then kind of like take these ingredients and then perform some kind of computation and then produce the best.

**29:09 Zheng Long (Automata):**
banana cupcake that would ever make. And the way how the fairy can actually produce this cupcake is the fairy would ensure that all the ingredients that I put in that magic box is indeed what I specify in my recipe. Exactly what I specify in my recipe. Then that fairy would follow the, would follow exactly again the instructions that's specified in the recipe. If the recipe says that stir the mixture three times. The fairy would make sure that it's three complete times, not one time more, nor one time less. So this magic box is basically what the enclave, what this trusted execution environment is. It allows you to have some code, which is like the recipe, and some data, which is like the ingredients to this recipe. And the enclave would actually execute it

**29:39 Zheng Long (Automata):**
instruction by instruction and without kind of like deviating from the instructions that you give it. So this is one of the properties that TEE provides to the users, integrity of the code that is executed in it. The other kind of like capability that TEEs provide is actually confidentiality. So back to the analogy, it's a magic box, right? This magic box actually prevents people from looking into the box to see what is inside the box. And what this, again, allows us to do is that secret recipe for the best cupcake in the world. It's kept as a secret within this magic box. So I'm able to pass this box to anyone that wants to make a cupcake.

**30:04 Zheng Long (Automata):**
they can provide the cupcake like I tell them to, the ingredients of the cupcake. And that magic box with the fairy inside will actually produce the cupcake for them. But the thing is, I can actually keep that secret recipe a secret and not tell anyone about this secret recipe. So this is the kind of confidentiality that tea is provided. So this is kind of like the L.E.5 on what a tea is. So kind of like...

**31:01 Zheng Long (Automata):**
To come back to reality, how is it actually implemented in an actual hardware? The way how it's being implemented is on each of the kind of like CPU chip that we have in all our machines, a secret key is actually being embedded into the chip itself. And what the CPU can do with the key is that the CPU can utilize the key to actually create this environment where any data that leaves the environment will actually be encrypted. And then it's only within that special space within the CPU that the data is being decrypted. And this is the guarantee that TEs can provide. With this secret, we can actually derive certain integrity,

**31:31 Zheng Long (Automata):**
properties about the CPU that we are using, like because the secret key is only known to the CPU. So the CPU kind of like have a public identity that we can verify. And if the CPU is able to kind of like answer some of the challenges that we give the CPU, then we can be relatively confident about the authenticity of that CPU. So this process is also called like remote attestation. Now, the thing is,

**32:29 Zheng Long (Automata):**
I think currently, or at least in the previous six months to a year, the narrative that is typically going around is that TEs is a direct competitor to cryptographic primitives like FHE, MPC, or ZK, zero-knowledge proofs. But the thing is, I think most of us here would agree that TEs are actually

**32:59 Zheng Long (Automata):**
in a kind of competitive position compared to all the other primitives, but instead it actually augments and complements all these existing cryptographic primitives. And by

utilizing TE properly, we can actually make use of a lot of interesting properties that TEs provide and mitigating away some of the downsides that TEs have. So I hope this would provide the listeners, the audience a kind of like a rough overview of what tea is about. And back to Boris.

**33:37 Host (Boris):**
Thank you. Yeah, I really, I really like that analogy. I will say that the automata literature and documentation did help me learn a lot about TE's and how they work and, you know, the general idea that you have this trusted hardware, which can make an attestation that the hardware has not been tampered with and is working properly so you can have this kind of verifiable and private computation. Super cool stuff. I think maybe, you know, I'm not sure if we should go into like a full explanation of CK or other cryptographic primitives or I'm thinking at this point, whenever it comes up, whoever is talking about it can just give like a two sentence explanation of it.

**34:09 Host (Boris):**
Just so we don't spend all day just on basic cryptography lessons. So I think maybe a cool way to move forward is to have folks from different projects talk about how they're using TEs in the context of their work. And why that design choice has been made or engineering choice has been made. I don't know who wants to go first, but we have an open floor and a lot of great speakers and I think a lot of cool use cases. So I can delegate to someone, but also feel free to just hop up.

**35:04 Zheng Long (Automata):**
Alright, Shenglong. OK, I think I'll get the ball rolling, and then people can continue from there. So like I mentioned, at Automata, what we aim to do is to bring machine trust to the entire Web3 ecosystem. And the way how we go about doing that is through this process called remote attestation. We have to establish. Before we start using this magic box, we need to make sure that this magic box is indeed a real magic box. There's a lot of phishing attempts, scammers, and then there might be a fake magic box. So the very first step is to establish that this is real. And this is done through this process called remote attestation.

**35:32 Zheng Long (Automata):**
The way how it works, I won't go into details, is that I've... I know certain properties of this magic box, the fairy that is living in this magic box. And then I would send this fairy some challenge. And the fairy would actually answer the challenge. It's like a secret code. We answer the challenge in a way that proves that, hey, I'm actually the real fairy that's living in this magic box. And if the magic box has a real fairy living in it, I can kind of like.

**35:59 Zheng Long (Automata):**
have a fairly high confidence that this is indeed a real magic box. So this is one of the services that we are pushing and we are providing to any TEE users out there. This ability to attest the TEE that they are using. So you might be asking, okay, now that I've established trust with the TEE, what can I do with it?

**36:27 Zheng Long (Automata):**
Like I mentioned, one of the properties, primitives that TEs provide is integrity of the code that is being executed. And what does this actually give you? This actually gives you the ability to prove that certain computation is done correctly. And the result from this computation, you can actually trust it. You can think of it as like a ZK,

**36:57 Zheng Long (Automata):**
kind of like a transparent ZK proof that just proves that the execution is correct without hiding any of the data that is going into the TE itself. And the actual kind of product that we have implemented with this idea is actually this multi-prover AVS. So we have this AVS with provers that runs TEs. Currently, they are Intel S-JAX machines. And they actually perform the state transitions for rollouts. So for example, for our MultiProver TE, we currently have support for both linear and scroll.

**37:26 Zheng Long (Automata):**
And our operators are actually following the block submissions that scroll has on the L1. We are redoing the execution. Given a particular state and the block, we would re-execute the block within the trusted execution environment, produce an output, and sign it off as a proof that execution results in this particular output. And what this does is that it actually enhances the robustness of all the existing rollout mechanisms. For example, if you are a ZK rollout, instead of relying solely on the correctness of the ZK proof, which being such a complicated implementation, might actually have bugs and there are a lot of ZK implementation bugs. Now,

**38:51 Zheng Long (Automata):**
we actually have two different proofs, a ZK proof and a T proof. And if there is no bug in either of the implementation, the results should agree with each other. And if they agree, we have a higher level of confidence about the correctness of it. So this is actually what our multi-prover AVS does provide to users.

**39:48 Host (Boris):**
Super cool, thank you. Okay, ooh, I saw Vanishvi's hand come up first, so I'll give her the floor next.

**39:54 Vanashree Rao:**
Thanks, Horace. So before describing exactly what we do, here is the framework to keep in mind. So I think of, so I agree with Zheng Chua that pitting TE against ZK is not the right framework. They can work together, they can add complementary values. That's one part of the framework. The other part of the framework is I think of TE as a cheap way of achieving ZK and slightly less secure way of achieving ZK. And this relates to the similarities between ZK and TE. And there's also a difference.

**40:48 Vanashree Rao:**
The difference between ZK and TE is that given that TE is more of a hardware security than of mathematical cryptographic security, what it brings to the table is something that ZK itself doesn't bring. And that is you can put like Zeng Xiuwa was saying, you can put stuff in, you can put data in the TE and have some level of assurance that even the person who is owning the TE doesn't know that data, right? This is a very different value proposition than ZK itself. ZK is just a tool. It's a mathematical tool. There is no guarantee like that. Now, what we are doing in our work is we are actually relying on the difference. We are not very much relying on the similarity, but we are relying on the difference.

**41:16 Vanashree Rao:**
By relying on the difference, what we can do is, you can work at a very high level. I'll first mention at a very high level, and then I'll go into the details. At a very high level, intuitively, there are two orthogonal, there are two orthogonal attack vectors you can think of in a situation where in attack vector one, you can use ZK to ward off that attack. In attack for attack vector two, you can use TE to ward it off because of the difference between them. So specifically, what are we doing? So think about zero knowledge proof generation. I said TE is a cheaper way, right? It means that ZK is a harder way. Deploying provers is not easy at all. All projects that have embraced ZK.

**42:14 Vanashree Rao:**
are breaking their head against this problem of how do we deploy these provers, how do we incentivize them? It's a huge headache for everybody. And this is one of the main problems that we are looking to solve at Fermat. And the way TE can help is in the situations where you have some sensitive data that you're trying to prove about, right? or some sensitive data that you want to prove about, it's very hard for you to do it on your phone or on your laptop. You may run out of your memory. What do you do? You want to delegate. But you cannot delegate right away. Why? Because it has sensitive information. How do you trust that person who has this bigger machine that they can handle your data safely? And you don't even want to let that person know about your sensitive data. That's where TE comes into play.

**43:12 Vanashree Rao:**
Right? So that's where you want to use TE because that person can have a huge, bulky, highly resourceful TE. And at a very high level, you can send your sensitive data to that person. That person can generate the proof for you while still not learning about your sensitive data. I said this is at a high level because this cannot be the complete solution. You'll probably have to have multiple TEs and multiple GPUs, in fact, with the... with each other and then generate a proof. That's where MPC comes into play. So I really don't like this putting one tool against the other. I really think that cryptography gave us all this, right? Gave us all this because there are these tools that are useful in different scenarios at different levels of security.

**43:40 Vanashree Rao:**
we have to start at what is needed, right? And what is needed has two components. What is the functionality? What is the security? And the third thing you need to ask is what are you willing to pay to achieve that functionality and achieving that security? You will pay in two things. You will pay in the UX to achieve that functionality, because ZK has bad UX right now. The other place where

you'll pay is the amount of security you'll get. Less security, better UX. That's the general framework. And these tools offer different functionalities and different securities. So you just need to...

**44:35 Vanashree Rao:**
use that framework and use the understanding of what is it that these different tools bring to the table. All in all, the summary of what I said is, they both bring very different things to the table, also somewhat similar, but very different things to the table. We are going to use both CK and TE to achieve some very cool, useful value additions.

**45:05 Vanashree Rao:**
to the ZK space for us to make ZK as accessible as possible. Happy to take any questions on what I said, but thank you.

**45:38 Host (Boris):**
Thank you, Vanesri, really salient points. And I think you captured the essence behind why we wanted to hold the space and help people understand the different reasons why you want to use one technology versus the other and how we can collaborate on all of this. And I'm going to give the floor now because he's had his hand up for a while and I think then we'll come back to Hong from Fala after because I know that Tycho is working on using both technologies for their roll-ups so Brecht, please.

**48:03 Brecht (Tyco):**
Yeah, I guess, well, to go for one, what was said before, yeah, so like similarities, well, still important and very useful. So like I said before, yeah, cheaper, faster, and also like easier, although like the easier parts. is getting less and less so with these ZKVM popping up. Where, well, yeah, before with ZK, it was more tricky to get everything up and running. And with TEs, if you had your existing application, then you could just run it and get a similar kind of proof of integrity and confidentiality. But yeah, with ZKVM, both are actually pretty similar now, I guess. Well, similar enough in complexity to getting using it and actually using it and kind of like a real product. Although I guess like, yeah, but yeah, both ZKVM, you have still some complexity with the verifier on chain. And with the TEs, you have the complexity of verifying the remote attestation on chain. So still some complexity there, but Automata and others, I guess, also building some infrastructure to make that much easier, which will be great to see. Also, yeah, I guess for the different part, it's kind of like the TEs.

**49:02 Brecht (Tyco):**
It's also easier because you can just see it as some kind of trust-a-server that you can interact with, which opens up new possibilities. I guess the Flashpods guys have been... Well, yeah, the OG evangelists of the EEs have been doing some great stuff there because the benefits of the EEs are pretty apparent about something like what ZK allows you to do. And these things are mostly less security-sensitive, which is great. It's more of like a... It's kind of like, yeah, either the amount of money you can lose is less, or it's just an inconvenience. For example, if you sent your transaction to a block builder and you want your transaction to be included, ideally, maybe you want to keep it private. Maybe you want to have some fairness about the fees that you're paying. And it's great that something like that, you can actually interact with a builder and you can get some guarantees of what code is actually executed there.

**50:00 Brecht (Tyco):**
and make sure that you're not overpaying for transactions. You're like, yeah, you keep your transactions private. And yeah, these things are not something that like ZK gives you, right? Because you kind of like have to, yeah, kind of like interact with this extra entity. So that's kind of like also like an interesting point. Also like the, there's like an interesting thing where like even like ZK and T directly can like use each other. As in, for example, for Tyco, a proposer that makes a block needs to find a person that wants to prove that block. But proving a block is kind of like ZK, so the costs are pretty unpredictable now, or whatever happens in the block, the costs has a big impact on what actually happens in the block. But the proposer obviously doesn't want to share the block data with the ZK prover, because then the ZK prover would steal them.

**50:54 Brecht (Tyco):**
So it's like another process. So that's also where TEs can come in to help, to make sure that you can either calculate the ZK proving, estimate the ZK proving costs in a TE, or just do some kind of other private sharing mechanism. So I think these are pretty interesting, pretty use cases where they can work together nicely. And also, yeah, some TEs, I guess, for the security aspect. I guess like for both ZK and like some TEs, basically breaking them is kind of like a nerdy thing. Or like you have to be smarter or something like that. But you also have something like some other alternative TE solutions like nitro enclaves. Yeah, you don't only have to be like some nerd that has some electron microscope or whatever to try to break things. You actually have to also like, we'd have to break into Amazon servers to kind of like.

51:50 Brecht (Tyco):**
to kind of like break the system. So I think it's also like nice kind of like a different like security aspects, even between like these to kind of like increase the security of like the whole system if you can come out and do. But that's it for me.

**52:05 Host (Boris):**
Thanks, Brecht. Yeah, just echoing again, there are different trust assumptions, security assumptions, but this can obviously be used in cool combinatorial ways to give us really performance systems that let us scale blockchains. So Hong, I'm going to give you the floor now. You've been patiently waiting. And I know you have a lot to say about how TEs can be used in crypto.

**52:35 Hong (Fala):**
Yeah, yeah, sure. I think all the speakers have reached really nice points. But here I'm trying to answer the original question how TE can be useful in the Web3 from different angle. Like people are already touching the point from use TE as a complementary prover. That's why we call that multi-prover for ZK rollup and maybe other ZK related use cases. Yeah, but if we back to the origin of what TE can offer. And even the origin of what blockchain is all about. We say decentralization, right? We use blockchain for decentralization, but under the hood, what we really need is not really decentralization, but rather trustless. We use decentralization as a tool to achieve trustless, because we don't want to trust anyone. So I am going to verify the blockchain on my own.

**53:34 Hong (Fala):**
or like in the ZK roll-up case, I'm not going to trust the people who operate any layer 2. So I'm going to verify the zero-knowledge proof so that I don't need to trust you. So that's all about trustless. If we think about trustless, then probably from one point, TE is roughly a trustless machine, a machine to bring your trustless, even without a lot of

**54:04 Hong (Fala):**
assumption of decentralization, because TE is just a black box. You put anything into the TE, and it guarantees the things you put into the TE will just be executed. Nobody can tamper the execution process, or steal the data from the TE, or inject any data to the TE. So that's already trustless, right?

**54:32 Hong (Fala):**
That's why in the ECC there was a very interesting talk by I believe Flashboot team. They said, analogy is, if you put anything inside the TE, anything from web2 inside the TE, it magically becomes a web3 project. Right? Like you put maybe some payment system into a TE, and since now nobody needs to trust the payment system itself, the people who run the payment system.

**55:01 Hong (Fala):**
it becomes something like Bitcoin or blockchain. If you put some traditional game into TE, then it becomes a decentralized game because you don't need to trust the people who operate the game. And if you put a blockchain inside the TE, and boom, you magically have a multi-prover layer to roll up. It's a TE roll up, and you can also combine, of course, combine with the other optimism or ZK.

**55:31 Hong (Fala):**
roll up cryptography, those tricks on top of that. But, well, it sounds too good to be true, but this is just something TE can achieve, but also with some cost. I'm not going to talk about the cost in this. topic right now because we also have the challenges topic later. But yeah, I think this is a very, very easy way to understand what TE can do. It's really powerful, it's really flexible, but also we need to use it with very, very we need to be very careful when using the TE because if we don't use that in the right way then it doesn't bring you all the...

**56:25 Hong (Fala):**
trustless properties magically. Yeah, and the last two pieces I want to add, it's about the real-world use cases. Of course, I was just kidding. It's not like you put anything into the magically become Web3 project. But in the reality, there are a few very interesting use cases beyond just the- use

TE as a multi-prover for ZK rollup. One thing and probably the most famous thing is MEV. So that's what a Flashboats team are building. They are building the next generation of Flashboats tech stack called SWAV. Basically running the MEV stack inside the TE for some property bring by TE. And why do they even need TE? Can they use ZK?

**57:21 Hong (Fala):**
as an alternative to solve their problem? Or can they use FHE or MPC as an alternative to solve their problem? The answer is no. Because the problem they are facing is actually dealing with some privacy data, and you don't want to leak the privacy data until the last point. This is why Vanisher mentioned that you cannot really use ZK for user privacy magically. Because if you are going to prove it by yourself, that's okay. You can run all the proof on your laptop or your mobile phone, and send the proof to the others to verify. But once you are going to deal with the data from multiple sources, like you send a transaction, I send a transaction, we join the transaction together,

**57:50 Hong (Fala):**
to produce a block and we don't want to review the content of the transaction. This is where ZK is super super hard to solve the problem. Because for ZK, you're going to generate the proof somewhere. But it cannot be me, it cannot be you, because I don't want to review my transaction to you or you don't want to review your transaction to me. This is where we call the multi-party computation. So this is where ZK cannot do. And the more formally, we call that if we want to operate on a shared global state, then ZK is not that helpful. This is where TE can help, because TE is just a trusted third party. You can feel free to inject whatever data you want into the TE and do some computation, and you get the results and the verifiable and with confidentiality.

**58:21 Hong (Fala):**
Of course, FHE has another problem, which is super slow. And in MEV case, time is measured by milliseconds. So that's why FHE is no go, at least for now. So yeah, this is one of the very interesting use cases in my mind. Another interesting use case is actually a little bit on the hype. It's decentralized AI, or sometimes we call it crypto AI. Of course, by decentralized AI, I never mean I'm going to generate the output from some AI model with the proof for the end user to verify. End users don't really give a shit about verifiability. They use chatgpt very happily. Nobody cares if chatgpt is going to give them a proof. But on the other side...

**59:19 Hong (Fala):**
A very interesting thing is now even OpenAI cannot give the... They are not releasing GPT-5 for reasons. The reason is they ran out of all the data. And where does the data come from? They scrap the data from all over the world. But that's all. They have already run out of all the data they have. Is there a better way to get even more data? The answer is the data is on your side, on my side.

**59:47 Hong (Fala):**
is all our privacy data. If we combine all the privacy data, we can have like maybe 10 times more data than OpenAI. And theoretically, we can train an even better model with all those data and get maybe some model much better than GPT-5, GPT-6. So if that's the case, then we can make the best model.

**01:00:16 Hong (Fala):**
and get revenue and distribute the revenue back to all the contributors to training this model. So in this case, the verifiability comes in where we need to make sure the supply chain of data supply, GPU supply, training process, make sure everything is verifiable in order to have all the whole pipeline up and running. So yeah, this is another interesting use case where TE is the best fit for something beyond just a ZK rollup. It's about like operating on shared, a global shared state. The case is WAF and also is useful for crypto AI where we can use the TE technology to build the best machine learning model, even beating the web two models. Yeah, there's a lot. Thanks for, yeah.

**01:02:10 Host (Boris):**
Let me speak. Thank you, yeah. You covered a lot of stuff there. I mean, I think a lot of really interesting use cases of TEs in the context of crypto, including AI, you know, teasing what Fala is doing. I'm gonna give the floor to case from 10 in a second, but I will say that we don't have flash spots joining us today, but the talk you mentioned by Shea at Modular Summit, I actually watched that video earlier today. I commented it on the thread for the space if anyone wants to check that out later. But case, please, thank you for waiting. Go ahead.

**01:02:47 Case (10):**
Thank you. And thanks, Han. That was really awesome, actually. I love that analogy you gave, where Web2 becomes Web3, once you have TEEs, because suddenly everything becomes trustless. And it's really cool. I'll be using that in the future. I also think that with TEEs, Web3 suddenly becomes Web2, in the sense that Web3 gains some of the powers that we take for granted in Web2, which are things like in Web2, things run on centralized servers and the operator of that server or the developer of the application that's running on that server gets to say, hey, I want these bits of my application to serve up this data and I want other bits to serve up private data or restrict, you can see this data. Like an easy example is Facebook.

**01:03:44 Case (10):**
upload a photo to Facebook and you say, hey, Facebook, only share that photo with friends and family. And Facebook will do that because it's able to, you know, leverage the fact that some things can be kept private. So, you know, in that sense, taking a web three, DAP, and placing it into a TEE suddenly gives you this superpower to keep some bits hidden and some bits public. And it's interesting because, I mean, when we were building You know, we were spending a lot of time sort of, you know, talking to institutions and institutions have, you know, they hire lots and lots of people to basically say no to stuff. So you want to get some new software in, there'll be layers and layers of people, there'll be the DB admin guy, there'll be some other security guys, some policy manager, and all their jobs are to kind of, you know, find a reason to say no to your tech stack.

**01:04:14 Case (10):**
And do you know what is white listed? It's TEs because they've been around forever. Banks already use them. TEs are basically what enabled banks to move their data centers into the cloud. They weren't just going to trust Microsoft or Google or whoever else with their data, right? There had to be this ability to prove that everything would be computed confidentially. And TEs is what enabled that. So, they're already...

**01:05:09 Case (10):**
whitelisted by institutions. So we talk a lot about taking web through mainstream. Well, there's one avenue right there, which is using tech that's already been whitelisted. Because things like CK, where it involves algorithms and mathematical proofs and stuff, that takes years and years and years to get through that wall of no. And perhaps we're talking like a decade or so. I think I also like the point Hung made about ZEs, are the only technology that enable shared global states and that's really key because that's really what determines what use cases you can build on CK versus TEEs. This idea of global states is really important. So you know, you imagine trying to build a DEX. A DEX is a great example of something where global shared state is needed because by definition a DEX constantly has liquidity added to it, liquidity removed, people trading and this is people all operating at once. And to do that, to have that global shared state where everyone's in sync with what's happening...

**01:06:07 Case (10):**
that's just not a use case that can be solved by CK. It needs TEEs. So for us, for example, we were able to take the entire reviem and deploy it into a TEE. And what that enabled us to do was give users or developers the exact same experiences they would have with Ethereum. There's no changes to the user experience, nothing to the developer experience. It's just solidity. Same frameworks, libraries, everything just works out of the box because it's the entire EVM, but it's the entire EVM now operating in this protected space. And I think that's really, really interesting as well because, you know, this talk is ZKEVMs, but ZKEVMs don't give you that encryption or privacy. They're just more about, you know, verification and they do an amazing job at that. You know, that's definitely the end goal when it comes to verification for sure. And, you know, even for us.

**01:06:32 Case (10):**
As an L2, we're currently in optimistic roll up, but we look forward to when we'll be able to generate CK proofs inside the TE, and then we'll kind of move to becoming a CK roll up, because it definitely makes sense in that context. I think the final thing I'll talk about is just use cases, because I did mention global shared states and how it massively opens up the design space. And

I think when people kind of think about privacy technologies like CK or TEs, they kind of default to, can we transfer?

**01:07:27 Case (10):**
tokens privately, but there's so much more we could be doing. There's so much cool stuff that can be built once you have this superpower. So some of the things we're excited about are things like on-chain games. So this is kind of deploying game mechanics directly on-chain so that they're censorship resistant, trustless, truly open source. Anyone can extend it, anyone can build upon the game. You know, if we kind of go back to the...

**01:07:49 Case (10):**
the original story of Ethereum in Vitalik, the reason he built Ethereum was because his character got nerfed in World of Warcraft, right? And he didn't want that to happen again. And, you know, if you are to build on chain games where the mechanics are genuinely on chain, then you know, you run into a problem, which is most games are incomplete information games. Not every game is a game of chess where you can see all the pieces on the board. You can see what player moves are. Most games require hidden elements. So a game I'd love to see built is one of my favorite games. In fact, there are two games that are very similar, which is Civilization and Age of Empires. So those are kind of turn-based strategy games. And you just play for points, or you play against another player, and they're great. But they would be awesome if they were on chain. Because the goal of those games is to build a civilization from scratch, and then eventually dominate the map or dominate every other player.

**01:08:21 Case (10):**
If you had real crypto assets baked into that game where you have to sort of, you know, use real currency or real tokens to kind of build up an army and feed your population and expand your military and expand your churches or whatever else, that would be incredible. And if you went out and sort of plundered someone else's village and you got to steal or take all their crypto assets as part of the gameplay, that's a whole new level of gaming. But that game, that side of game needs, you know, something trustless, right?

**01:08:49 Case (10):**
in order to work. So it needs something like web3. It needs to be on chain. And that sort of game, well, you shouldn't be able to see what other players' units are, where they are on the map. The map needs to remain hidden. Whatever things you're researching as part of the game, that needs to be hidden as well. So you need to have incomplete information. And that's what TEEs give you. And it's interesting because what they give you today, it's not even theoretical. These things just need to be. people just need to go out and start building and experimenting these sorts of games because it could change gaming and it's super exciting. And I think just other things like dark pool trading, that's another one that's pretty important, exists in the real world in TradFi and still gets to be solved in Web3. I think building social networks with the ability again to have private messaging and share photos but keep them hidden to only followers, that's another one that's interesting.

**01:10:15 Case (10):**
And I think sort of perhaps more technically, I saw a tweet the other day, which said, Hey, we're all talking about shared sequences and decentralizing sequences, because we want to make sequences trustless. But what about if you just threw a sequencer, an L2 sequencer into a TEE, you'd immediately solve that problem, it immediately become trustless. So you can kind of see this, you know, this this power, it's kind of like this shortcut to doing so many, you know, solving so many difficult problems. And the answer is obvious, just throw it in a TEE.

**01:10:45 Case (10):**
And I guess like the final use case is MEV, right? You know, there's all these complex mechanics for solving MEV, but guess what? If your network just ran inside a node, inside a network of nodes or running TEs, well, your mempool by definition would be encrypted. No one would be able to front run you. You would solve MEV right out of the gate. And I think that's becoming more and more important. Mika recently announced rules in the EU that MEV is against regulations. And if you allow MEV on your chain, you're non-compliant. So yeah, I think MEV, big problem. TEE, great solution that's available today. I'll leave it at that.

**01:11:12 Host (Boris):**
Case, thank you. You mentioned a lot of really interesting use cases. I think this audience is probably already of the belief and understanding the importance of like open protocols, open data, shared state, and how this enables us to build cooler, better systems for everything we do on the internet. So to kind of bridge things back from like Web2 to Web3, I'm going to bring Mauro up to talk about what Aligned is doing with regards to this, because you do talk about, you know, you just mentioned how right now TEs are a technology that can give us all these properties. And we do talk a lot about how, you know, we'll be able to run whatever code we want within a ZKVM soon. But we still have a bit of a ways to go, and we will get there. But right now, TEs offer this capability. So Mauro, I will give you the floor.

**01:12:24 Mauro (Aligned):**
So yes, I think everyone here has talked better than what I could about TEs and all the things that we can build with them, the similarities and differences with CK and so on. So what we are trying to do here is to link all of this with Ethereum and we have noticed in a line that some of the problems that TEs are facing. are very similar to what many CK systems are facing. We were talking with Sheng, I remember some months ago, and the cost of verifying this TE is in Ethereum to actually use it is around like 5 million gas, probably it's going to get reduced by 2 million and this is as expensive as a StarCraft for example. It's a lot of money for perspective you can put only four of these Verification before collapsing a block in Ethereum. So it's expensive and it is slow

**01:13:35 Mauro (Aligned):**
So what we are doing here now is integrating in the same system through risk taking and by using Egon layer to have this consensus on the correct attestation of the GE proofs so we can match them all together and they really become totally inexpensive, like you can do it really efficiently or site you and then just post the results. And the other advantage is that we can even mix CK proof. with the attestation and do an aggregation of both verifications together. And so we start becoming like an integrity layer. Now it's not only CK, but it's TE, CK, everything that needs to be used to guarantee integrity on computations and be used in Ethereum, it can be used in online. So in that sense,

**01:14:34 Mauro (Aligned):**
We are really happy now to be working with our automata Yeah They are incredible. Thank you for being here so So we will really soon be seeing these these applications working Over a lie. I know if worries maybe Is a question or something that you think I'm missing?

**01:15:03 Host (Boris):**
No, Mauro, I think you covered it really nicely. I mean, we're excited to help anybody use Ethereum as a sort of like settlement layer for their proofs or attestations. So great to be working with Atomza and please reach out if you're facing similar, cost problems around the work that you're doing with TE attestations and of course, ZK proofs. Okay, so I think we've heard from everyone who kind of signed up to be a guest here. talking about the different ways TEs can be used and how to maybe think about this technology in this context. I'm looking at the time and we're sort of like over an hour into the space already, but I did wanna leave a little bit of time to talk about a couple of things that I think would be pretty interesting to cover sort of around the challenges of using TEs and how we can work together as an industry to make this technology more useful. So I don't know if anybody...

**01:16:02 Host (Boris):**
has some specific things they want to say on the topic. But yeah, please go ahead.

**01:16:07 Hong (Fala):**
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Since we are running out of the time, so I will keep it as brief as possible. I think using TE itself, it can of course solve a lot of problems, but at the same time, TE is not that easy. It is cheap, it is very powerful, but it's not easy for a few reasons. First of all, using TE doesn't mean you just rent a TE from maybe some cloud provider like GCP or AWS, putting your program inside and that's done. That's far from done. Using a TE means you're going to put your program somewhere, host it for temporary proof. And at the same time, you need to prove that. To prove that...

**01:17:00 Hong (Fala):**
That's where we need remote attestation. And this is what Automata is best at. They are building the attestation layer for all kinds of TE. Not just the Intel SGX, but also the other kinds of TE. Probably, Jolong can give more like add-up comments later. Just touch a little bit. So proof, it's

not simple. It's very hard to verify on Ethereum. So they have done a lot of amazing job. to deal with that. Second, we don't only need the tamper proof, we also need unstoppable, to make our things unstoppable. This become another problem. You just imagine if you find the TE, put your program inside, and everything looks so far so good, but then maybe the TE provider just...

**01:17:59 Hong (Fala):**
just close the service to you, or they just pull out the plug of the power supply from your computer, what will happen? Then that means you're not going to have your service up and running forever. So unstoppable program is another very, very challenging problem we need to solve. Just imagine. When people are building the roll-ups, they need some kind of data availability layer. And it turns out data availability layer is super, super hard. That's why there are a bunch of projects building the DA layer for like one, two years. Eventually, they can have something. And now we need the availability for computation. This is even harder. So, yeah, I think availability is another challenge. We are...

**01:19:00 Hong (Fala):**
going to solve maybe with all the efforts from the Webstreet builders. Yeah, I think those are the two biggest challenges from the technical side. But there are also the challenges from the other side, like how we can let everyone understand TE. This is also very, very challenging. TE has been there for, I think, the first generation of...

**01:19:29 Hong (Fala):**
The production level of TE was released in 2016, and now it's already like 8 years. But still very few people really understand the power, how powerful and what are the drawbacks of TE. So having the event like this, we have a Twitter space to just spread the word, telling people, new tool, new crypto primitive to help us to solve the problems in Web3. I think this is super super helpful. Yeah, so that's the three points in my mind. Thanks.

**01:20:14 Host (Boris):**
Thank you, Hong. Yeah, no, I completely agree. Like you said, this is exactly why we are hosting this space. Just try to educate the general community on this technology and how it can be used. And then we can also all weigh in on opinions and better understand the current discourse around the topic. So I just added Proofcast as a speaker. I know they're doing some cool stuff with TEs as well. Do you guys want to? Hello? Yeah. Can you hear me? Welcome.

**01:20:44 Proofcast:**
Yeah, thank you. Thank you for having me also this late. But yeah, the talk was very, very interesting. And I wanted to share just a couple of things, I think, and I share with the other speakers. I really like when Vani Shreve said that ZK and T are not really in computation. we when Han was talking about trustlessness, because what I think is that really, again, we have some sort of trilemma, something very similar to what was the classic trilemma, you know, about speed, security and decentralization, that you cannot really achieve all three of them in one single chain, it was that the classic definition of it.

**01:21:43 Proofcast:**
But in our space of proofing things, basically, you can have speed and cost, let's say, on one side and on the other, the idea of decentralization and security, which you can summarize in trustlessness if you want. And in my opinion, really, we don't have one tool that solves everything.

**01:22:12 Proofcast:**
You cannot have something that is super cheap and super, super secure, of course. And what we think at Proofcast is that we can just mix things and give the user the ability to easily build for TEs or for ZK if you want. And that these two technologies, again, they are not one or the other. They can go together depending on the application you need.

**01:22:42 Proofcast:**
So, yeah, I totally agree with these ideas. And yeah, proof cause we are building a VM that abstracts and the complexity to go one direction or towards the other. And yeah, so just wanted to add that.

**01:23:12 Host (Boris):**
Thank you. Yeah, really, really good points from everyone about the importance of educating the public and abstracting away complexity to make these systems more accessible to developers. This is something we feel very strongly about at Aligned. You know, we believe that this technology is powerful, but if it's not easy for people to use, then it's not going to get used. So I think I just want to be mindful of time now. There's a lot of other interesting topics that we sort of put on the list on the agenda.

**01:23:40 Host (Boris):**
for today's space. So I think what I want to say now is maybe just if anyone has any closing thoughts, feel free to unmute, put your hand up. And if okay, yes, we'll get one more point from from Zhenglong and then I'll wrap things up.

**01:24:08 Zheng Long (Automata):**
Yep, just just to kind of like wrap it up. I think if there's one thing that I want like that I hope that the audience is able to take away from this particular X-theta spaces is that TEs itself, it's really a tool just like all the other kind of cryptographic primitives that we have. And it being a tool has its own pros and cons. And just like what Venishree mentioned earlier, like look at the problem.

**01:24:38 Zheng Long (Automata):**
understand the problem, identify what are some of the requirements you need. For example, the requirement is that I need to have low latency or the requirement is like I need to secure a large amount of value. And depending on the problem you have, use the appropriate tools in conjunction.

**01:25:03 Zheng Long (Automata):**
with each other in order to maximize and achieve what you want to do because each of the tools have their own pros and cons. For example, ZK is really secure but you can't perform, if you want privacy, you can't perform proving on a remote server. You have to do it yourself. ZK proofs are not really suited for shared global, shared secret

**01:25:32 Zheng Long (Automata):**
global states. For MPC, there's the issue of collusion. But MPC allows you to have a kind of like mathematical primitives for you to collaboratively perform certain computations. TE is fast, efficient, but there are certain trust assumptions and the security is kind of like, there's a reliance on physical security.

**01:26:00 Zheng Long (Automata):**
in the entire trust model. So like I said, that one thing is understand the technology and then use the right tool to kind of like make the, provide the best experience for your users if you are a builder or like a solution for a particular problem that you are working with. in the web space or you are just a normal developer working in a software house in the web industry. I think this would be super useful for everyone.

**01:26:45 Host (Boris):**
Thanks, Eng. Yeah, I think we all feel the same way. It's really cool stuff. I'm very grateful for the chance to have learned from a bunch of experts on the topic today. Again, just being mindful of time, I think we'll wrap the space up now. So I just want to thank all the listeners for tuning in, of course, all the guests and co-hosts, all the projects here today. Give them a follow if you want to keep learning and seeing how they're using

**01:27:15 Host (Boris):**
If there's interest, we can definitely do more spaces like this. I think there's a lot of other topics we didn't get to cover today. If you're interested in participating in a future space, the guest cohosting, shoot us a DM. We have a telegram group where we're coordinating some of this. We're excited to hear from more projects in the space that are using trusted execution environments. So yeah, I guess thanks again and until next time.

**01:27:47 Host (Boris):**
Thank you so much. Thank you very much. All right. Thanks. Have a great day everyone. Thank you Boris. Thank you everybody.

**01:27:58 Host (Boris):**
Thanks, everyone.
